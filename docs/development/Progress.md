    - [x] **PROBLEM**: But logs show NO activity from ManualLocationViewModel or ManualLocationScreen
    - [x] **PROBLEM**: This indicates the UI navigates but the ViewModel isn't being initialized
    - [x] **ROOT CAUSE**: Navigation callback may not be properly connected or ViewModel factory issue

        - ✅ Fixed SensorRepository instantiation with proper parameters
        - ✅ Restored shared repository pattern for proper state management
        - ✅ Added comprehensive logging throughout the navigation pipeline

    - [x] **CONFIRMATION**: App properly switches from compass state to Manual Location state
*   [x] **CRITICAL ISSUE: GPS Location Not Being Passed** ([Technical.md](../technical/Technical.md))
    - [x] **PROBLEM**: Manual Location screen cannot access GPS location from compass screen
    - [x] **PROBLEM**: LocationRepository state not being shared between screens
    - [x] **PROBLEM**: Manual Location falls back to Kuala Lumpur coordinates instead of actual GPS
    - [x] **ROOT CAUSE**: Location state management not properly shared across navigation
    - [x] **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: 
        - ✅ Implemented proper location state sharing between screens using shared repositories
        - ✅ Enhanced ManualLocationViewModel with better timeout handling (5 seconds)
        - ✅ Added fallback location logic with proper error messages
        - ✅ Improved error handling and user feedback
    - [x] **TESTING**: Verify Manual Location uses actual GPS coordinates (3.318747,101.595681)
    - [x] **CONFIRMATION**: Map loads with user's actual location instead of fallback
*   [x] **Diagnose Map Loading Issue** ([UX.md](../technical/UX.md))

    - [✅] **USER REQUEST**: Implement a real map system instead of synthetic boxes.
    - [✅] **SOLUTION**: Implemented OpenStreetMap with a smart caching system.
    - [✅] **CREATED**: `OpenStreetMapTileManager.kt` and `OpenStreetMapView.kt`.
*   [✅] **Fix GPS Location & State Management** ([Technical.md](../technical/Technical.md))
    - [✅] **PROBLEM**: Map was not using live GPS data and state was not preserved.
    - [✅] **SOLUTION**: Implemented a stateful `ManualLocationViewModel` that fetches location once, and passed the confirmed location back to the compass via a navigation result.
    - [✅] **RESULT**: Manual location is correctly initialized and overrides the compass location when confirmed.
*   [✅] **Fix Map Dragging & "Snap-Back" Issue ("Tile Space" Refactor)** ([UX.md](../technical/UX.md))
    - [✅] **PROBLEM**: Dragging the map was imprecise and caused a visual "snap-back" upon release.
    - [✅] **SOLUTION**: Refactored the entire map view to operate in a precise "tile space" coordinate system instead of using inaccurate pixel-to-degree approximations.
    - [✅] **ADDED**: `latLngToTileXY` and `tileXYToLatLng` conversion functions for high-precision calculations.
    - [✅] **REMOVED**: The flawed `dragOffset` and `Canvas.translate()` logic.
    - [✅] **RESULT**: The map dragging is now perfectly smooth with no "snap-back" effect. The visual state and data state are always in sync.

### **Step 3: Implement Simplified AR Enhancement** ✅ COMPLETED
*   [✅] **Add Camera Preview to AR Screen** ([AR.md](../technical/AR.md))
    - [✅] Integrate CameraX preview in ARScreen.kt

    - [✅] Add proper camera permissions and lifecycle management
    - [✅] **CONFIRMATION**: User can see real camera view with directional UI
*   [✅] **Implement Compass Sensor Integration** ([Technical.md](../technical/Technical.md))
    - [✅] Add compass sensor reading to AR screen via ARViewModel
    - [✅] Calculate real-time phone orientation and Qibla direction
    - [✅] Map compass data to Qibla direction with proper angle calculation
    - [✅] **CONFIRMATION**: Direction arrow responds to phone rotation
*   [✅] **Add Flat Phone Detection** ([UX.md](../technical/UX.md))
    - [✅] Implement accelerometer-based flat detection in AR
    - [✅] Use same logic as compass screen for consistency
    - [✅] **CONFIRMATION**: Phone orientation detection works reliably
*   [✅] **Create Simplified Directional UI** ([UX.md](../technical/UX.md))
    - [✅] Design clear arrow pointing to Qibla direction
    - [✅] Add 🕋 Kaaba icon and status indicators
    - [✅] Include clear instructions: "Face this direction to pray"
    - [✅] **CONFIRMATION**: User can easily follow the direction to pray

### **Step 4: AR Implementation Validation** ✅ COMPLETED

    - [✅] Confirm directional accuracy matches compass screen
    - [✅] **CONFIRMATION**: AR works reliably with simplified, focused UI

## Phase 11: Compass Core Refactoring ✅ COMPLETED

*   [x] **Implement Compass Core Refactor Plan**
    - [x] **Details**: Executed the full refactoring plan outlined in [COMPASS_CORE_REFACTOR_V2.md](../technical/COMPASS_CORE_REFACTOR_V2.md).
    - [x] **Action**: Switched from manual sensor fusion to `Sensor.TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR`.
    - [x] **Action**: Simplified `SensorRepository` by removing complex figure-8 detection logic.
    - [x] **Action**: Refactored `CompassViewModel` to handle a new hybrid (automatic and manual) calibration flow.
    - [x] **Action**: Updated `CompassScreen` and `CalibrationOverlay` to use the new, simplified state.
    - [x] **Result**: Fixed the non-functional "Calibrate" button and improved overall compass accuracy and stability.

## Phase 12: Post-Refactor Bug Fixes ✅ COMPLETED

*   [x] **Fix App Sticking on "Initializing"**
    - [x] **Problem**: After the refactor, the app was stuck on the "Initializing compass..." message.
    - [x] **Root Cause**: The `trySend()` call was missing from the `callbackFlow` in `SensorRepository`, so new orientation states were never emitted to the UI.
    - [x] **Action**: Moved the orientation calculation logic directly into the `onSensorChanged` listener and re-introduced the `trySend(newState)` call.
    - [x] **Result**: The compass now initializes correctly and displays the heading.
*   [x] **Fix Calibration Overlay Behavior**
    - [x] **Problem**: "Calibrate" button showed the overlay, but it disappeared immediately if the sensor status was `OK`.
    - [x] **Action**: Introduced an `isManualCalibrationInProgress` state in `CompassViewModel` to differentiate between user-initiated and sensor-prompted calibration.
    - [x] **Action**: The automatic observer now respects this state and no longer closes a manual session.
*   [ ] **Fix Compass Needle Animation**
    - [ ] **Problem**: The compass needle performs a full 360-degree rotation when crossing the 0/360 boundary.
    - [ ] **Status**: Multiple attempts to fix the animation logic have failed. The issue persists.
    - [ ] **Next Step**: Requires a deeper investigation into Jetpack Compose animation handling for circular values.
