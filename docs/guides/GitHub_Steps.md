# GitHub Setup Guide for Qibla Finder App

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to properly upload and configure your Qibla Finder Android app on GitHub with automated builds and releases.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub account with access to [https://github.com/bizzkoot/Qibla_Finder](https://github.com/bizzkoot/Qibla_Finder)
- Git installed on your local machine
- Android Studio (for local development)
- GitHub CLI (optional, for easier management)

## 🚀 Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

### 1.1 Initialize Git in your project
```bash
cd /Users/muhammadfaiz/Custom\ APP/Qiblah_Finder
git init
```

### 1.2 Add your GitHub repository as remote
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/bizzkoot/Qibla_Finder.git
```

### 1.3 Verify remote connection
```bash
git remote -v
```

## 📁 Step 2: Prepare Files for Upload

### 2.1 Review and update .gitignore
The `.gitignore` file has been updated to include:
- ✅ Android build artifacts (`*.apk`, `*.aab`, `build/`, `.gradle/`)
- ✅ IDE files (`.idea/`, `*.iml`, `.vscode/`)
- ✅ Local configuration (`local.properties`)
- ✅ Keystore files (`*.jks`, `*.keystore`)
- ✅ System files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)
- ✅ Debug and log files

### 2.2 Files to include in repository
Ensure these essential files are present:
- ✅ `app/build.gradle` - App dependencies
- ✅ `build.gradle` - Project configuration
- ✅ `settings.gradle` - Project settings
- ✅ `gradle.properties` - Gradle properties
- ✅ `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` - Gradle wrapper
- ✅ `app/src/main/` - Source code
- ✅ `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - App manifest
- ✅ `README.md` - Project documentation
- ✅ `LICENSE` - MIT license
- ✅ `Progress.md` - Development progress
- ✅ All documentation files (`.md` files)

### 2.3 Files to exclude (already in .gitignore)
- ❌ `app/build/` - Build outputs
- ❌ `.gradle/` - Gradle cache
- ❌ `.idea/` - IDE settings
- ❌ `local.properties` - Local SDK path
- ❌ `*.apk` - Built APK files
- ❌ `*.aab` - Android App Bundle files

## 🔧 Step 3: Create GitHub Actions Workflow

### 3.1 Create workflows directory
```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

### 3.2 Create Android CI/CD workflow
Create file: `.github/workflows/android.yml`

```yaml
name: Android CI/CD

  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:

        key: ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle*', '**/gradle-wrapper.properties') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-
          
    - name: Build with Gradle
      run: ./gradlew build
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: ./gradlew test
      
    - name: Build debug APK
      run: ./gradlew assembleDebug
      
    - name: Upload APK artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: app-debug
        path: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
        
    - name: Build release APK
      run: ./gradlew assembleRelease
      
    - name: Upload release APK artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: app-release
        path: app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Set up JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'
        cache: gradle
        
    - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
      run: chmod +x gradlew
      
    - name: Run unit tests
      run: ./gradlew test
      
    - name: Run instrumented tests
      run: ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

## 📝 Step 4: Update README.md
